# Tatum Blockchain Connector
This repository is used as a place to find all connectors to the blockchains, which are integrated inside Tatum API.

## Structure
There is a `blueprint` folder, where there is an example connector prepared for you. You should extend `*Controller.ts` and `*Service.ts` files and implement the required methods, you would like to expose via Tatum API to the developers.
On top of that, there are `<blockchain>-connector` directories, where custom integrations are being created. Feel free to fork the repo, create your connector and open a PR. All common files which are used across connectors are located in `common` folder.

## Integration to Tatum API
Before the integration itself, please read [Integration guide](./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).
As soon as you finish and test your connector, please reach out to the Tatum team on [Telegram](https://t.me/tatumio). They will then integrate your blockchain inside the Tatum API.
