      <p>NFT stands for "non-fungible token." Non-fungible means that each token is unique and irreplaceable. This principle gives NFTs their value and gives rise to a wide range of interesting potential use cases.<br/>
      NFTs can be used for nearly any digital asset or good to ensure authenticity and scarcity. The possibilities are endless, but here are a few example use cases:
      <ul>
      <li><b>In-game assets</b> - NFTs can be used to create unique collectibles in the form of characters, weapons, skins, or other equipment. Players can resell or trade assets directly as they choose, and their authenticity is easily verifiable. No more eBay, no more scammers.</li>
      <li><b>Music and other digital media</b> - NFTs can be used to create rare and unique collectible digital releases. Similarly, NFTs can be used to sell videos, art, or any other type of digital media. Collectors can own digital originals of their favorite songs, movies, or virtually anything else you can imagine.</li>
      <li><b>Digital sports merch</b> - Trading cards, memorabilia, classic moments in sports history, and one-of-a-kind experiences can also be sold as NFTs, opening up a world of possibilities for sports leagues and teams worldwide. The NBA Top Shot website sells collectible “moments” from the league’s history, and at the time of writing, the website is completely sold out and closed for new sign-ups.</li>
      <br/>
      These endpoints wraps up standard NFT implementation and operations, which can be done with them. Endpoints are blockchain agnostic, the only differentatior is the <b>chain</b> parameter in the URL path.<br/><br/>

        <p>Deploy NFT Smart Contract. This method creates new ERC721 Smart Contract (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain. Smart contract is standardized and audited.
        It is possible to mint, burn and transfer tokens. It is also possible to mint multiple tokens at once.<br/>
        Tatum now supports NFT these blockchains:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
        <li><b>Polygon (Matic)</b></li>

        <li><b>Tron</b></li>
        <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
        </ul>
        It is possible to see the code of the deployed contract <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-middleware/blob/master/src/contracts/erc721/ERC721Full.sol" target="_blank">for EVM chains here</a>
         or here <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/flow-contracts" target="_blank">for Flow</a>.<br/><br/>
        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages or Tatum Middleware with a custom key management system is possible.

        <p>Update royalty cashback value for one NFT Token. This method updates the first royalty value of specific author for 1 token.
        If royalty value is set to 0, it will disable the royalty system for the token. Only from author's address of the royalty can change it's royalty value, not the owner of the token.<br/><br/>
        Tatum now supports NFT these blockchains:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
        <li><b>Polygon (Matic)</b></li>
        <li><b>Celo</b></li>
        <li><b>Harmony.ONE</b></li>
        <li><b>Tron</b></li>
        <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
        </ul>
        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages or Tatum Middleware with a custom key management system is possible.
